          <span>Hello Everyone!</span>
          <p>
           My name is Keith Jhaeron Maing Cayatoc, I am a 20 year old IT student from Nelson New Zealand and I am currently enrolled for the Diploma in Web Design and Development. I am aiming to become a 
           Software Developer. Everything may be new to me but I am determined to study in an earnest manner on learning more on what is going on around the Information Technology Industry.
           <br>
           <br>
           Although I have no experience being in a workplace, I am very much thrilled and eager to grab any internship opportunities which can help me gain knowledge and understanding on being an IT personnel.
